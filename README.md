Introduction
Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables. This lesson introduces the concept and basic procedures of simple linear regression. We will also learn two measures that describe the strength of the linear association that we find in data.

What is Multiple Linear Regression?
Multiple linear regression is the most common form of linear regression analysis.  As a predictive analysis, the multiple linear regression is used to explain the relationship between one continuous dependent variable and two or more independent variables.  The independent variables can be continuous or categorical (dummy coded as appropriate).
